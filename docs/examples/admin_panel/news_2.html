						Microsoft announced in June that it
						 was buying the Git repository and collaboration platform GitHub for
						 $7.5 billion in stock. That acquisition has received all the necessary
						 regulatory approvals and has now completed. Nat Friedman, formerly of
						 Xamarin, will take the role as GitHub CEO on Monday.
					</p><p>
						 The news of the acquisition sent ripples through the open source world,
						 as GitHub has become the home for a significant number of open source
						 projects. We argued at the time that the sale was likely one of
						 necessity and that of all the possible suitors, Microsoft was the best
						 one due to common goals and shared interests. Friedman at the time
						 sought to reassure concerned open source developers that the intent was
						 to make GitHub even better at being GitHub and that he would work to
						 earn the trust of the GitHub community. Those views were reiterated
						 today.
					</p><p>
						 Since then, Microsoft has joined the Open Invention Network, a patent
						 cross-licensing group that promises royalty free licenses for any patents
						 that apply to the Linux kernel or other essential open source packages.
						 This was a bold move that largely precludes Redmond from asserting its
						 patents against Android and should mean that the company will no longer
						 receive royalties from smartphone manufacturers.
					</p><p>
						 Sources close to the matter tell us that Microsoft's decision to join
						 OIN was driven in no small part by the GitHub acquisition. GitHub is
						 already a member of OIN, which left Microsoft with only a few options:
						 withdraw GitHub from OIN, a move that would inevitably upset the open
						 source world; acquire GitHub as some kind of arm's length subsidiary
						 such that GitHub's OIN obligations could not possibly apply to
						 Microsoft; or join OIN too, as the most straightforward approach that
						 also bolstered the company's open source reputation. Microsoft took
						 the third option.
